{"name":"Arduino","tagline":"Andy's sample arduino apps","body":"### Andy's Arduino Code\r\nThis is a collection of software components for use with Arduino.  Most of the content here I've collected from other sources and put my own polishes on (e.g., reformatting, adding comments, using\r\nmeaningful variable names, making more OO).  Where I've taken code, I include a link to the original source and where possible, I have notified the original authors of my changes.  I'm putting this here in hopes someone else will find this useful.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
